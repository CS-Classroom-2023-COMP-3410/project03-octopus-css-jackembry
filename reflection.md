This took longer than I would like to admit. To be fair this stuff is all completely new to me but I still didn't think something like this would take the time it did. It took me a bit to get down the difference between the external and inline css and when to do what. I honestly don't even know if I did much inline css in the html. Now that I'm looking at the index.html, I realize I changed the structure a bit by adding the quiz right and left rule in the html so that I could then individually modify in the css. At this point I'm not going to change it as I feel like it was beneficial to learn how that works. Other than that things went fine. Maybe it all took to long because I was trying to be too particular. This did make me look at each line though and understand what it did on my screen or if it had no purpose at all and I could just scratch it given ChatGPT sometimes over does it with unneeded code. Besides how long it took me, I'm satisfied with the outcome of my replica png and I hope you are too.
